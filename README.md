## Flash

Once built you can flash the `./build` directory to your device using WebIDE.

```js
myDebug.enable('*');
```

Runs the lint and tests.

```js
$ npm test
```

## Dev mode

In dev mode we watch for changes and automatically re-build the app.

```bash
$ npm start
```

## Custom commands

Custom Command is a feature to enable 3rd party apps to register their voice
commands. Voice commands will be predefined actions in the short term. We may
use [Action of schema.org](http://schema.org/Action) as base and extend it as
action list. 3rd party apps should use JSON-LD to state which actions they
support. Once the actions detected, Vaani calls the apps to handle that.

commands](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS/Vaani/Custom_Command).
